# Counter Application - React

## Objective

In this assignment, I built a counter application using React and the useState hook. The counter allowed me to increment, decrement, and reset the count value, while also letting me input a custom number for incrementing and decrementing. This project helped reinforce my understanding of state management, event handling, and controlled inputs in React.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a simple counter app with the following functionality:

- Display the counter value (current state)
- Increment and decrement the counter using buttons
- Prevent negative values (i.e., the counter should not go below 0)
- Reset the counter to 0
- Custom Input: I could input a custom number that would determine how much the counter increases or decreases by with each click.

## Features

1. Display the Counter:
   - The counter started at 0 and is displayed on the screen.
2. Increment and Decrement Buttons:
   - I added buttons to increment and decrement the counter. The decrement button prevents the counter from going below 0.
3. Custom Number Input:
   - I added an input field to let users set a custom number input for incrementing and decrementing.
4. Reset Button:
   - I added a button that resets the counter to 0.

## How to Run Project

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Navigation to counter

## Conclusion

This project helped me better understand how to manage state using React's useState hook and how to handle user input with controlled components. By building a simple but flexible counter app, I gained a solid grasp of state management, event handling, and the reactivity system in React.
